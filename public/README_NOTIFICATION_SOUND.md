# Notification Sound File

The notification sound file should be a pleasant, short (1-2 seconds) audio file in MP3 format.

## Current Status
A placeholder file exists. To add a proper notification sound:

1. **Download a pleasant notification sound:**
   - Visit: https://notificationsounds.com/
   - Or: https://mixkit.co/free-sound-effects/notification/
   - Choose a calm, pleasant chime or bell sound

2. **Replace the file:**
   - Download the MP3 file
   - Replace `public/notification-sound.mp3` with your downloaded file
   - Ensure it's named exactly `notification-sound.mp3`

3. **Recommended sounds:**
   - Soft bell chime
   - Pleasant notification tone
   - Gentle alert sound
   - Avoid harsh or jarring sounds

The sound will play when new notifications arrive (if sound is enabled in user preferences).
